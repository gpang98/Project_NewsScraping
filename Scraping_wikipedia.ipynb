      "Prior to 1926, a successful ministerial by-election was required for members of the British House of Commons (pictured) to regain their seats after being made ministers. This requirement originated from 17th-century ideas of parliamentary independence from the Crown, which appoints the ministers; while early attempts were made to fully separate ministers and Parliament in a manner similar to that of the future United States, a compromise was reached instead to merely require new ministers to face a by-election to join Parliament. This by-election was in practice usually, but not always, an uncontested formality, and was gradually reformed before finally being abolished in 1926. Ministerial by-elections spread to British colonies in modern-day Canada and Australia, where they were likewise all abolished by the mid-20th century, ending with Western Australia in 1947; in Canada, they played a major role in the 1926 King–Byng affair before being abolished federally in 1931.

      "The yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), also known as the white-rumped miner, is a species of colonial honeyeater endemic to Australia. It is a medium-sized, grey passerine bird with yellow throat markings, legs, and bare patches around the eye. The common name miner is an alternative spelling of the word myna, and is shared with other members of the genus Manorina. Though miners were originally named due to their resemblance to the common myna of India that shares similar yellow eye-patch and legs, common mynas are from the starling family and are not closely related to the honeyeaters. This yellow-throated miner was photographed in Sturt National Park in New South Wales, Australia.\n",
